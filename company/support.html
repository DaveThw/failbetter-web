     <p class="support">We are keen to establish new collaborations with organizations and individuals. There are three ways to support our development:</p>
	  <div class="support-left">
	   <h2>Fail Better Friends</h2>
	   <p>This scheme will launch in Spring 2012 to coincide with our anniversary at Warwick, including performances and special events.</p>

	   <h2>Learning Events</h2>
	   <p>Fail Better Productions has a team of gifted educators who can run a range of practical workshops and learning experiences for any age group.</p>

	   <h2>Artistic Residency</h2>
	   <p>We have recently completed a highly successful university residency, as documented in '<i>Open Space Learning</i>' (published by Bloomsbury Academic).</p>
