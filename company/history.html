     <p>
      The company was founded in 2001 at the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/ - Opens in a new window">University of Warwick</a> with our <a href="../productions/pinter/" class="fbp-show">Pinter Double Bill</a> (<span class="fbp-show">A Kind of Alaska</span> and <span class="fbp-show">Silence</span>).<br />
      This production opened at the <a href="http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/ - Opens in a new window">Welsh College of Music and Drama</a>, Cardiff in May of that year and closed at the <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.rsc.org.uk/ - Opens in a new window">RSC</a> Summerhouse, Stratford-Upon-Avon in June. During Spring 2001, we also represented Britain at the Play in English Festival in Bratislava, Slovakia. Our <span class="fbp-show">Pinter Double Bill</span> played to a packed house on the festival's closing night and was attended by the British Ambassador.

     <p>
      In August 2002, our production of Sarah Kane's <a href="../productions/crave/" class="fbp-show">Crave</a> was a sell-out success at the <a href="http://www.underbelly.co.uk/edinburgh" target="_blank" title="http://www.underbelly.co.uk/edinburgh - Opens in a new window">The Underbelly</a> during the <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/" target="_blank" title="http://www.edfringe.com/ - Opens in a new window">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a>.<br />
      The show was also a critical success, receiving four-star reviews from <cite>The Scotsman</cite> (<q>"gut-wrenchingly effective"</q>), <cite>The Herald</cite> (<q>"delivered with well-drilled commitment"</q>), <cite>Fest</cite> (<q>"timeless and achingly human"</q>) and <cite>The List</cite> (<q>"a diamond of a show"</q>). We were also subject of an Institute of Ideas panel discussion where the production was described as the best since the original.

     <p>
      Fail Better moved to London later that year and in April 2003 began working with a new ensemble on Ovid's Echo and Narcissus and plays by Samuel Beckett.<br />
      In Summer 2003, the devised work <a href="../productions/echoandnarcissus/" class="fbp-show">Echo and Narcissus</a> ran for three weeks at the <a href="http://www.whitebeartheatre.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.whitebeartheatre.co.uk/ - Opens in a new window">White Bear Theatre</a>, Kennington to critical success: <q>"It is challenging, gripping, creative and the acting is assured."</q> - <cite>The Stage</cite>; <q>"A short visually arresting piece that'll have you scurrying back to your Ovid."</q> - <cite>Time Out</cite>
     </p>

     <div class="image-frame-right"><img src="history_head.jpg" alt="[Head]" title="Head" /></div>

      In the autumn of 2003 the company presented a rehearsed reading of <a href="../productions/head/" class="fbp-show">Head</a> by Zo&euml; Simon at the <a href="http://www.whitebeartheatre.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.whitebeartheatre.co.uk/ - Opens in a new window">White Bear Theatre</a>, London.

     <p>
      Since 2005 company members have been working in a variety of theatre, education and production roles. During this time, Jonathan began an association with <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/capital/" target="_blank" title="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/.../capital/ - Opens in a new window">The CAPITAL Centre</a> (<a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/ - Opens in a new window">University of Warwick</a> and <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.rsc.org.uk/ - Opens in a new window">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>) which led to Fail Better being invited to stage <a href="../productions/stasis/" class="fbp-show">Stasis: Beckett Shorts</a> at The CAPITAL Carnival to mark the opening of their new building in May 2007. In June we held a work-in-progress showing of our <a href="../productions/madman/" class="fbp-show">Diary of a Madman</a> (after Gogol) at the <a href="http://www.pegasustheatre.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.pegasustheatre.org.uk/ - Opens in a new window">Pegasus Theatre</a>, Oxford.
