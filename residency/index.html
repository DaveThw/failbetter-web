This involved:</p>
     <h2>Learning Events: embedding the workshop methodology</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Applied Performance: a range of creative learning experiences (from Chemistry to Commerce) and the development of an ensemble of performers to contribute to public events (from Neuroscience to Networking).</li>
      <li>Performing Philosophy: an induction session for first-years, a third-year workshop as part of Textual Studies and the annual Phil/Lit Weekend. These events were part of three years of collaborative work with the Philosophy and Literature course.</li>
      <li>Rehearsing Beckett: practical workshops for a range of modules within the departments of English and Theatre Studies. A specific area of expertise for our company's director, these sessions offered cutting-edge performance-based learning.</li>
