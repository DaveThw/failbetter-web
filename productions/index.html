         <q>"I don't seem to be able ... to depart"</q>.<br />
         A rare opportunity to see a double bill of short plays by Samuel Beckett, staged together for the first time.  As their stories and lives come to an end, the characters consider what has happened, how things may have been different and what remains of the past. Static bodies in concrete stage images begin two intensely focused dramas of the mind.
