       <p><q>"There's in things a void - lifeless, changeless, endless -"</q></p>
       
       <p>We took four texts into the studio: <em>On the Nature of Things</em> (Lucretius), <em>The Teachings of Pythagoras</em> (Ovid), <em>The History of an Error</em> (Nietzsche) and <em>Suffering and the Eternal Recurrence of the Same</em> (Broome).</p>
       
       <p>We also played with mirrors, lamps, postcards and darkness.</p>
       
       <p>Some interconnections emerged and some things fell away.</p>
       
       <p>I.<br />
       <em>The sum of the dark?<br />
       The answer's always zero.<br />
       Nothing. Everything.</em></p>
       
       <p>II.<br />
       <em>The body in shades<br />
       Casting webs of fixity<br />
       Measureless to reach.</em></p>
       
       <p>III.<br />
       <em>Measuring the void.<br />
       Real space<del>time</del>, this space<del>time</del> is no space<del>time</del>.<br />
       I scribe and transcribe.</em></p>
       
       <p>On the evening of 1st October, an audience including of scientists, young people, academics and practitioners gathered to watch 30mins of devised work and take part in a post-performance discussion. They were then invited to comment further:</p>
       
       <p><q>"<em>Loved the moment when we turn up to the constellations, and the way the language really cascades as we get to the end!</em>"</q></p>
       
       <p><q>"<em>The gap between the silent body and the speaking voice was striking.</em>"</q></p>
       
       <p><q>"<em>I saw an experiment and an experimentalist within an experimental piece of art.</em>"</q></p>
       
       <p>Fail Better Productions is currently developing a series of science-related projects and events.</p>
